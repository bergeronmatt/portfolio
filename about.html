                <p>Hi, I'm Matt. I'm a UI/UX Designer living in Columbus, OH. If you take a loot at my resume below, you'll see that I'm not your
                    average visual designer. I originally went to University and received an undergraduate degree in Applied Exercise Science and a graduate
                    degree in Sports Performance. I wanted to be a professional Strength Coach at the collegiate and professional level, and help as many people 
                    as possible through my online business. At one point I was a professional athlete with several sponsors, and even working for one of them as 
                    a wholesale manager. Unfortunatly, that business went bankrupt, and I suffered a pretty nasty injury that took me out of competing for a while.
                    <br><br>
                    I found out quickly that in the world of Athletics and Fitness, most people don't care about how good of a coach you are, or how well educated you may be,
                    they really only care about how popular you are. I lost my job, my sponsorships, and I'm back at square-one so to speak career wise, but compared to what I lost,
                    I gained 10 fold more. I had to teach myself about marketing online, both with websites and social media. I taught myself HTML/CSS, visual design, and I'm even in
                    training now to become a Full Stack Web Developer so I can create a project front to back. I've learned from the companies I worked with not only on how to be 
                    successful, but on what to avoid so as to have a powerful reputation, and avoid critical failures.
                    <br><br>
                    I am relatively new at UI/UX design, but I already have the skill not only to design projects, but bring them to life. I have been taught through adversity, and found
                    the skills on my own to begin to succeed not just in one field, but another. I have more than tenacity, I have dedication.
                </p>
